Basic Installation
==================

    KGuitar now uses `cmake' in place of the old `configure' shell script.
`cmake' is used to produce new make files

To make a generic installation on most Unix based systems use the following
commands as a regular user:

	cmake .
	make kguitar

And then type the following as root:

	make install
